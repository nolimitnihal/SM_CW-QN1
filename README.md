This coursework NHIAL ANDREW and it involved simulating the checkout process at an e-commerce store with one cashier. The goal was to determine the average time customers spend in the system and the percentage of time the cashier is idle. The simulation was run for 20 customers over a 3-hour period using random interarrival and service times. Excelâ€™s Data Table feature was used to replicate the simulation 50 times for analysis. Results were summarized in a report and uploaded to GitHub, with the process recorded using Screen Pal Screen Recorder.
